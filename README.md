# Training and validation datasets

train.1.xyz + train.2.xyz: Training dataset (Note that due to the file size limitations of github, the training dataset is split into two files and one can obtain the the whole training dataset by "cat train.1.xyz train.2.xyz > train.xyz")

valid.xyz: Validation dataset

potential.mtp: MTP potential file ( type 0 is Al, type 1 is Ni)
